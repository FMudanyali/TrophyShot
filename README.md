# TrophyShot by Team CBPS

## What does it do?

Just like in PS4, it takes a screenshot whenever you unlock a trophy.

Best used with [reScreeny](https://github.com/dots-tb/reScreeny)

## How do I install it?

In config.txt inside tai folder,

TrophyShot_shell.suprx goes under \*main

TrophyShot_app.suprx goes under \*ALL

like this:

	*main
	ur0:tai/TrophyShot_shell.suprx

	*ALL
	ur0:tai/TrophyShot_app.suprx

After modifying the config, reboot.
